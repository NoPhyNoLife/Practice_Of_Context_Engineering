This project was shelved during my first year at university, and now it seems more appropriate to call it “*Context Engineering*” rather than its original name, “*Neuro Assistant*”, which was merely an analogy to the word *agent*. Interestingly, both names have since been adopted by the industry, and I’m glad I had the foresight.

Shelving the project didn’t mean I wasn’t frustrated or felt defeated—**I certainly was**—but I still appreciated the difficulties and challenges it presented. These same challenges, later encountered by leaders in the field, validated that my decision to abandon it wasn’t without reason.
